# Modelling-nanotrack-for-skyrmion
Academic Supervisor- Prof. Susmita Saha.

We use Mumax3 to model micromagnetic simulation of a nanotrack on which we can move skyrmions. We succsessfully showed that we can move single and double skyrmions on our modelled racetrack with a reasonably low current density.
